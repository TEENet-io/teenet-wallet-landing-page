      },
      {
        question: 'Does every action require approval?',
        answer: 'No. Routine actions can move through normally. Approval is only required when an action crosses a rule you\'ve set, such as a transfer limit or another sensitive condition.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can the agent move funds on its own?',
        answer: 'The agent can only act within the rules and approval requirements attached to the wallet. It does not get unlimited authority.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How does approval work?',
        answer: 'When an action needs your sign-off, you review it and confirm it with Passkey in a dedicated approval flow.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why use Passkey here?',

        question: 'Is this built for developers too?',

      },
      {
        question: 'Why is approval more trustworthy here?',
        answer: 'Because approval is not enforced only by the wallet app itself. Sensitive actions are verified in TEENet\'s protected control layer, so a normal app or backend cannot approve them on its own.',
