      {
        question: 'How is it different from a regular wallet?',

      },
      {
        question: 'Does every action require approval?',
        answer: 'No. Routine actions within predefined rules execute without interruption. Only actions that exceed thresholds or interact with contracts outside the allowlist trigger approval.',

      {
        question: 'How does approval work?',
        answer: 'When a sensitive action is triggered, you receive an approval link in chat. You open the approval page and verify with Passkey or biometrics. The action proceeds only after successful verification.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why is this approval flow trustworthy?',
        answer: 'Approval is not a chat reply — it is an independent verification step using Passkey. Rules define real execution boundaries, not UI hints. And the wallet logic runs on TEENet, a hardware-protected trusted execution environment where trust is verifiable.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Is it fully open source?',
