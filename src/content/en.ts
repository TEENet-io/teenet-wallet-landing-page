    items: [
      {
        question: 'What makes this different from a regular wallet?',
        answer: 'Most wallets either give your agent full access or no access. This wallet lets your agent handle routine actions while enforcing transfer limits, contract allowlists, and approval requirements inside a hardware-protected environment — not just in application code.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Does every action require approval?',
        answer: 'No. Routine actions can move through normally. Approval is only required when an action crosses a rule you\'ve set, such as a transfer limit or another sensitive condition.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can the agent move funds on its own?',
        answer: 'The agent can only act within the rules and approval requirements attached to the wallet. It does not get unlimited authority.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How does approval work?',
        answer: 'When an action needs your sign-off, you review it and confirm it with Passkey in a dedicated approval flow.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why use Passkey here?',
        answer: 'Passkey makes important approvals feel familiar and simple, while keeping them tied to a stronger, user-controlled confirmation step.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Is this built for developers too?',
        answer: 'Yes. Developers and builders can explore the wallet app and skills on GitHub, then adapt the flow for their own OpenClaw experiences.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why is approval more trustworthy here?',
        answer: 'Because approval is not enforced only by the wallet app itself. Sensitive actions are verified in TEENet\'s protected control layer, so a normal app or backend cannot approve them on its own.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I get started?',
        answer: 'You can join the beta, watch the demo, or go to GitHub if you want to explore the implementation and build on top of it.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I build my own agent app on TEENet?',
        answer: 'Yes. TEENet is a general-purpose platform for applications that need hardware-isolated execution, managed key custody, and configurable approval policies. The wallet is one example — you can build any AI agent application that needs secure key management and rule enforcement. Start with the SDK at github.com/TEENet-io/teenet-sdk.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I export my private keys?',
        answer: 'No. During the Beta period, private keys are generated and stored exclusively inside hardware-protected environments and cannot be exported. This is a security decision to protect your assets while the platform matures — it ensures your keys are never exposed to software or operators. Your on-chain assets are always yours: you can transfer them to any external wallet at any time. We will revisit this policy based on community feedback and security assessments as the platform evolves.',
